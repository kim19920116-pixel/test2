# Blueprint: Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This application is a web-based lottery number generator. It provides a simple, visually appealing interface for users to generate a set of six unique random numbers, simulating a standard lottery draw. The application is built using modern, framework-less web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and focuses on a clean user experience, responsive design, and engaging visual effects.

## Design & Features

### Visual Design
*   **Theme:** A dark, modern theme with a subtle noise texture on the background to create a premium feel.
*   **Color Palette:** A vibrant color palette will be used for interactive elements and the generated numbers to create a lively and energetic look. Key colors include a deep blue/purple background, bright glowing text for numbers, and a call-to-action button with a shadow/glow effect.
*   **Typography:** Expressive, bold typography will be used for the title, and clear, legible fonts for the numbers and buttons.
*   **Layout:** A centered, single-column layout that is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Iconography:** While not heavily reliant on icons, a simple favicon will be included.
*   **Visual Effects:**
    *   **Number Animation:** Generated numbers will fade in with a slight delay, creating a sequential reveal effect.
    *   **Button Glow:** The "Generate" button will have a soft, multi-layered drop shadow to make it feel "lifted" and interactive.
    *   **Number Styling:** The generated numbers will be displayed in colored circles.

### Features
*   **Number Generation:** Generates six unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
*   **Interactive Button:** A single button to trigger the number generation process.
*   **Responsive Display:** The generated numbers are displayed in a clean, responsive layout.

## Current Plan

1.  **Modify `index.html`:** Set up the basic structure of the application, including a title, a container for the numbers, and a generation button.
2.  **Modify `style.css`:** Implement the full visual design, including the dark theme, layout, typography, button styles, and number circle styles.
3.  **Modify `main.js`:** Write the JavaScript logic for generating the unique random numbers and dynamically updating the DOM to display them.
